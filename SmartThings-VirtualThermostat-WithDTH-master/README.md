# SmartThings-VirtualThermostat-WithDTH
Virtual Thermostat Device with Device Type Hander to create a proper thermostat device (Works With Google Home and Alexa)

Simply allows the creation of a new Device thats shows as a thermostat, using the teperature from a selected temperature sensor, and an on off outlet for heating
also allows a contact sensor to disable the thermostat when open (no heating when window/door is open) (optional)

a lot of the code is from the [Samsung SmartThings Virtual Thermostat](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/SmartThingsPublic/blob/master/smartapps/smartthings/virtual-thermostat.src/virtual-thermostat.groovy) example
and lots of the UI elements and a bit of code came from [NST-Manager Thermostat Handler](https://github.com/tonesto7/nest-manager/blob/master/devicetypes/tonesto7/nest-thermostat.src/nest-thermostat.groovy)

install both the smartapp and the device handler otherwise nothing will work, once setup it should be pretty strait forward.
